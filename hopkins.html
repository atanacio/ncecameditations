						<p>I am interested in ideas of structure, architecture, containment, and permanence. My work takes those interests and applies them to porcelain vessels, adding to the continuum of expressive ceramic containers. Porcelain is my drug of choice. It satisfies and frustrates and I am fully addicted.</p>
						<p>Porcelain is associated with the upper class, and is seen as fragile and pure. My use of industrial textures, loose style of construction, and employment of non-white porcelain questions those assumptions. I thoroughly enjoy the effects of luster- that hint at value and worth as well as cultural signifier. The surfaces and designs bring my working class roots to porcelain vessels.</p>
						<p>In this series I have added cast concrete bases. They carry with them implications and references to Brutalist architecture, civil engineering, and coastal breakwalls. The base also acts as a floor for the bottomless vessel it supports.</p>
						<p>My urban environment, artists Gordon Matta Clark and DeChirico and Serra, Brutalist and Modernist architecture (earlier I.M Pei and Louis Kahn), backyard forts, model cars, 19th century European porcelain, Song Dynasty porcelain, and Modernism all inform and affect the work.</p>
