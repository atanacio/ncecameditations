						<p>My vessels are called “Syncope” and the name refers to a musical expression.</p>
						<p>I make vessels with structural compositions of colored porcelain, based on a personal immersion in a technique unfolded within a graphic universe.</p>
						<p>The work with the cylinders is circumstantial, and the pattern created in the manufacturing process. I use a technique which consists of cutting thin slabs of colored porcelain into strips, which I unify with a thin, vibrating line of colored slip. I work two-dimensionally to construct the pattern with vertical and horizontal lines into one long slab, which are finely assembled into a cylindrical jar: a Syncope.</p>
						<p>The outside surface of the vessel is mirrored on the inside, creating a visual relationship.</p>
						<p>I am inspired by woven Bauhaus fabrics, and I work with proportionality in lines and colorfields, citing Anni Albers and Josef Albers as inspiration, as well as my Nordic heritage.</p>
						<p>I use repetitions of lines with different distance, width and thickness to create intricated patterns. My newest work is about gradient colors to make a vanishing effect.</p>
						<p>My vessels are translucent and fragile, and at the same time with a strong, geometrical expression.</p>
