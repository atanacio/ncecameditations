				 <p>Roxy is a ceramic artist from Rochester, NY. In 2019 she graduated with a BFA in ceramics at Rochester Institute of Technology. This fall Roxy returned to RIT as an artist in residence. Her work consists of abstract sculpture that explores themes of visceral material presence, repetition, and transcendence of the material quality of clay through surface exploration. Roxy is grateful for having grown up quietly and comfortably, allowing her the time and space to explore both the natural world and her internal world and the places where they merge. She draws on these imprints from her upbringing as inspiration for her work, expressing a childlike wonder of her own emotional landscape through material while attempting to relate to and represent the collective emotional landscape. Roxy teaches ceramics and art classes at the Flower City Arts Center and at the Creative Workshop at the Memorial Art Gallery in Rochester. </p>

						<p>This body of work consists of abstract ceramic sculpture and uses repetition, unconventional surface treatment and organic imagery to elicit a visceral and conflicting response in the viewer: one of both discomfort and recognition of the familiar. These forms are simple-cylinders and cubes- allowing the material and the texture to speak the loudest. Their presence is heavy and perhaps even crude, but with an elegance and a sense of movement found in nature. They are strange and even disturbing both in their alien-ness and their uncanny familiarity.</p>
						<p>The cylinder conveys an extreme simplification of a reference to the human body. We are vertical columns of matter, channels for energy to pass through and create hold our form. Whatever form we take, we grow and move in communities, towards and away from one another and even from ourselves. Through swift and lose handling of the material, I capture this flowing undulation of growth permanently in a plastic material form in order to connect the viewer with their deep and visceral feelings, both fearful and comfortable, of being a human with a body in relationship with other humans.</p>
