				 <p>Hilda Nilsson is a designer and ceramicist based in Copenhagen, Denmark. She graduated her MA from The Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts in 2017. She is previously educated in traditional ceramics crafts techniques in Stockholm, Sweden. She works with an experimental approach to production methods and processes with focus on the material expressions in clay. She has worked primarily with 3D-printed ceramics the past 6 years and is interested in the use of additive manufacturing in the crafts field. She has exhibited her work in Europe and Asia.</p>

						<p>My main interest and focus in ceramics is experimenting with different ways to work with the material. I make unique crafts objects that often are inspired by functional everyday objects. I work spontaneously in that I usually don’t have a finished piece or shape in mind at first. The clay's way of reacting to different processes is what drives my work forward.</p>
						<p>I have worked primarily with additive manufacturing (3D-printing) the past few years. I find inspiration in the juxtaposition of the classic crafts material and something digitally created. The ceramic material continues to surprise me, so I like to have a work process that surprises me too and the 3D-printing technique continues to do that. Ever since I started using additive manufacturing it has been important to me to get involved in the production process, whether it’s adding to, removing or deforming the pieces. It is a way for me to get a personal touch to something digitally created.</p>
